<h1>Additional activity classifications</h1>
<p>There are many kinds of humanitarian and development financing, each of these can be classified. Funding can come in different <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/FinanceType/">finance types</a> (including grants, loans, bonds) and <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/AidTypeVocabulary/">aid types</a> (such as specific project support, core support, pooled funding). It can also come from different types of donors (e.g. as official development assistance from governments, or private development finance from development banks or philanthropic foundations). Organisations publishing data may also want to specify whether an activity or transaction concerns a particular policy area, such as gender equality or disability.</p>
<p>Using the IATI Standard, publishers can assign different classifications to their data as well detailing an activity’s <a href="../activity-thematic-focus/"><span>thematic focus</span></a>. These help users to understand what type of financing it is and how it can be used. As money flows from one organisation to another, these classifications might change. For example, finance from a donor may be untied, then later become tied to a specific purpose as it flows down through multiple implementing partners.</p>
<p>The classification categories used in IATI are aligned, where possible, with those used by other internationally recognised data standards or initiatives, such as the <a href="https://www.oecd.org/dac/">OECD DAC</a> and the <a href="https://www.agendaforhumanity.org/initiatives/3861">Grand Bargain</a>.</p>
<p>Please note that all classifications in IATI are optional. Activities should include only classifications that are relevant. Some donors require their grantees to publish certain classifications in their activities.</p>
<p>Classifications covered in IATI include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/AidTypeVocabulary/">Aid-type</a></p></li>

<h2>What classification information can be published?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>An activity can have multiple policy-marker attributes. Unlike the element <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/sector/">sector</a>, percentages do not need to be added to each policy-marker.</p></li>
<li><p>The classifications of default-finance-type, default-flow-type, default-aid-type and default-tied-status apply to the whole IATI-activity. These can be overridden within a single transaction.</p></li>
<li><p>If an entire activity is wholly tied, partially tied or untied, it is recommended the appropriate default-tied-status code is used.</p></li>
<li><p>When used at transaction level, tied-status should be published for outgoing and incoming commitments only.</p></li>
<li><p>If an iati-activity has more than one tied status it is recommended that the published commitment(s) are split into the relevant tied, untied and/or partially-tied amounts and tied-status is published at transaction level.</p></li>
<li><p>All IATI classifications are optional. Not all classifications may be applicable to an activity.</p></li>

If vocabulary 99 (reporting-org) is used, a link to the codelist using the @vocabulary-uri attribute should be included; there must also be a description of the code in the <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/policy-marker/narrative/">narrative</a> element. This helps ensure that users can understand the meaning of the code.
