<h1>Results information</h1>
<p>Results describe the benefit or intended benefits of an activity; these can be broken down into <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/ResultType/">types</a>: outputs, outcomes and impacts. Updating results regularly means that data users can track an activity’s progress and learn from other organisation’s activities - such as whether or not the activity was a success and what challenges were faced. Both positive and negative results should be included.</p>
<p>IATI offers a rich structure, allowing organisations to publish results which are meaningful to them. Publishers are able to link their results to agreements with their donors e.g., by coordinating results publishing with their partners, alliance and/or stakeholders. Often, the published results will relate to the framework of the agreed objectives for the activity, or activities. There is no single way to publish results in IATI and this can make results hard to understand. This guidance helps explain what can be captured in the IATI Standard.</p>
<p>How results data is published will depend on the structure of an organisation’s activities and their results frameworks. For example, if a programme is being published, overarching results details may be published in the parent activity, with more detailed results being published in the sub (child) activities. Or, if the publisher is working in an alliance, each organisation could publish results using the same indicators so that their results are comparable.</p>
<p>To better understand publishing and using results data, it may be helpful to look at a visualisation. <a href="http://www.d-portal.org/">d-portal</a> is one tool that helps to visualise results data, for further information see <a href="../understanding-results/"><span>Understanding results data</span></a>.</p>
<p><em>Please note:</em> security implications may also prevent results data from being published, or require results to be aggregated. Any security considerations should be outlined in an organisation’s <a href="/en/guidance/preparing-organisation/organisation-data-publication/information-and-data-you-cant-publish-exclusions/">exclusion policy</a><em>.</em></p>
<section id="understanding-results">
<h2>Understanding Results</h2>
<p>There are many elements and attributes that can be used and not all may be needed. For organisations wanting to publish results data, IATI recommends first thinking about <strong>what</strong> the results are that they want shown and then looking at <strong>how</strong> they can be mapped onto the IATI Standard.</p>
<p>Results in IATI are generally one of three types:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Output (1)</strong>: A direct consequence of the activity, e.g. vaccinations delivered to X number of children.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Outcome (2)</strong>: A short term effect the activity has contributed to, e.g. lower rates of infection after a vaccination programme.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Impact (3)</strong>: A long term effect the activity has contributed to, e.g. improved life expectancy.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Each activity can have multiple results of each type, i.e. multiple outputs.</p>
<p><strong>Measuring results</strong></p>
<p>Each result is measured by one or more indicators. For example, the number of different types of vaccines provided and how many local staff were trained to give them.</p>
<p>Each indicator can have a given time period with a start and an end date. This is the time period in which the indicator is being measured, e.g. agricultural season or school term. A baseline value shows the progress at the beginning of the time period. Often, the baseline is 0 as no work has yet been carried out. A target value provides the progress that should have been achieved by the end of the period. The actual value provides the progress that was achieved during the given time period. You can track the progress of an indicator over time; to enable this an indicator needs to have multiple time periods. e.g. yearly time periods for 2018, 2019 and 2020.</p>
<p>The indicator description can be used to help explain what’s being measured and how. For example, whether the published values are aggregatable (the data user should add them up to get the total) or cumulative (the data user should look at the most recent value to get the total).</p>
<p><em>Please note:</em> the indicators for different types of results (outputs, outcomes and impacts) will often be measured across different time periods, ranging from a few days to multiple years.</p>
<p>Each indicator must have a measure attribute; this describes what the indicator is being measured in. The three most common <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/IndicatorMeasure/">measure types</a> in IATI are:</p>
<p><strong>Numerical (quantitative) measures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Unit (1)</strong>: e.g. number of workshops delivered.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Percentage (2)</strong>: e.g. percentage of the population who have received a vaccine.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Indicators with these measures should have numerical <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/baseline/">baseline</a>, <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/">target</a> and <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/actual/">actual</a> indicator values. If a high number shows improvement, the ‘ascending’ boolean should be set to 1 (true). If a low number shows improvement, the ‘ascending’ boolean should be set to 0 (false).</p>
<p><strong>Descriptive measures</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Qualitative (5)</strong>: e.g. this is often a description, such as detailing more favourable attitudes towards gender equality amongst trained staff</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Indicators with this measure type should have descriptive <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/baseline/comment/">baselines</a>, <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/target/comment/">targets</a> and <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/result/indicator/period/actual/comment/">actuals</a>. This is captured within the comment elements; the value attribute should not be published.</p>
<p>Indicators can also be linked to existing results frameworks, e.g. the Sustainable Development Goal Indicators. For more information on how to do this please see: <a href="../sdg-guidance/"><span>How to use the IATI Standard for publishing and using data on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)</span></a>.</p>
<p>Different donors have their own requirements when it comes to publishing results. Guidance from each donor can be found on the <a href="/en/guidance/preparing-data/donors-reporting-requirements/">Donors Reporting Requirements</a> page.</p>
<p><strong>Example usage</strong></p>
<p>An activity is working towards the outcome that ‘people to have access to independent media covering a diverse range of outcomes’ (title). One of the ways this is being measured is through ‘the percentage of journalists who feel free to express their opinion’ (indicator). This is measured through a bi-annual survey where they are asked to score how free they feel on a scale of 1 - 4.</p>
<p>The starting value (baseline) was 15% of journalists felt free to express their opinions. At the end of the chosen time period, the target was set at 50%. The activity did meet its target, as by the end of the period (actual) 53% of journalists felt free to express their opinions.</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;result type="2"&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;
    &lt;narrative&gt;People who have access to independent media covering diverse options.&lt;/narrative&gt;
  &lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;description&gt;
    &lt;narrative&gt;Further explanation of the expected result.&lt;/narrative&gt;
  &lt;/description&gt;
  &lt;indicator measure="2" ascending="1" &gt;
    &lt;title&gt;
      &lt;narrative&gt;The percentage of journalists who feel free to express their opinion (scoring 3 or 4)&lt;/narrative&gt;
    &lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;description&gt;
      &lt;narrative&gt;
        1 = Not at all free
        2 = No, not entirely free
        3 = Yes, up to some level
        4 = Yes, entirely free
        This is measured through a bi-annual survey amongst journalists.
      &lt;/narrative&gt;
    &lt;/description&gt;
    &lt;baseline year="2012" value="15"&gt;
            &lt;comment&gt;
        &lt;narrative&gt;Baseline measured in a survey amongst 1083 journalists in country x.&lt;/narrative&gt;
      &lt;/comment&gt;
    &lt;/baseline&gt;
    &lt;period&gt;
      &lt;period-start iso-date="2012-01-01" /&gt;
      &lt;period-end iso-date="2015-12-31" /&gt;
      &lt;target value="50" /&gt;
      &lt;actual value="53" /&gt;
    &lt;/period&gt;
  &lt;/indicator&gt;
  &lt;indicator&gt;

    ...

  &lt;/indicator&gt;
&lt;/result&gt;
