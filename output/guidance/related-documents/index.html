<p>Further information about an organisation or activity can be provided by using the <strong>document-link</strong> element. This link can be added to several places, including the organisation file. It can be attached to each activity, and at multiple points within a result element.</p>
<p>A publisher may want to add more detail about their work, such as the organisation’s annual report, the <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/overview/conditions/">conditions</a> <em>(new guidance coming soon)</em> attached to any funding, or a report on the results or impact the activity.</p>
<p id="where-can-related-documents-can-be-added">
<h2>Where can related documents can be added?</h2>
<ul>
<li>Each document-link needs to contain a URL to a publicly accessible webpage or document.</li>
<li>The URL must begin with either ‘<a href="http://">http://</a>’ or ‘<a href="https://">https://</a>’.</li>
<li>If documents are available in other languages and stored separately, these should be added as additional document-link elements.</li>
<li>Including the <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/FileFormat/">file-format</a> attribute helps to inform users about what to expect from the document.</li>
<li>A number of donors require their grantees to publish specific documents.</li>
