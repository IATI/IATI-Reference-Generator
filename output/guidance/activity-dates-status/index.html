<h1>Activity dates and status</h1>
<p>Each activity published to IATI should specify the time period in which the activity took place. Both the planned start and end dates of an activity can be provided, then the actual start and end dates can be added when known. Each organisation can choose the point at which an activity has started and ended.</p>
<p>Within an activity, the transactions, budgets, planned-disbursements and indicators can be published. Each of these should contain a specific date or time period.</p>
<p>Activities can also be given a ‘status’, such as ‘closed’ or ‘cancelled’. These help data users understand what stage an activity is at. It’s important that the status of an activity is kept up to date.</p>
<section id="what-activity-information-can-be-published">
<h2>What activity information can be published?</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Dates must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD, e.g. 2018-03-16.</p></li>
<li><p>Dates can be updated at any point.</p></li>
<li><p>Activities can be published at any point: when they are planned, ongoing or completed.</p></li>
<li><p>There are two types of date: planned and actual.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Planned start and planned end dates represent when the project was expected to start or end. These dates can be in the future.</p></li>
<li><p>Actual start and actual end dates represent the actual start and end dates. These should be published in addition to the planned dates, only once the activity has actually started or ended. These dates must not be in the future.</p></li>
