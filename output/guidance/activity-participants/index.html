<h1>Activity participants</h1>
<p>In IATI data, each organisation publishes from its own perspective and includes details of organisations it is working with. Each publisher should be publishing the money coming into their organisation and what they are doing with it. The work they do may involve other organisations. These could be organisations from which they are receiving money from, organisations to which they are giving money, or partner organisations.</p>
<p>There are multiple points in Organisation and Activity files that can reference the organisations a publisher is working with. They should be identified by their name, unique IATI organisation ID (referred to as an IATI Org ID) and activity IDs (also referred to as IATI Identifiers). Their role and what type of organisation they are must also be added. For guidance on how to formulate an IATI Org ID see <a href="/en/guidance/publishing-data/registering-and-managing-your-organisation-account/how-to-create-your-iati-organisation-identifier/">here</a>.</p>
<p>It is useful for data users to know who an organisation is working with, as well as being able to trace the flow of funds up and down the delivery chain. This is enabled by publishers including the unique IATI Org IDs for the external organisations they are working with. IATI Org IDs can be added to activity data by use of the <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/participating-org/">participating-org</a> and <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/transaction/">transaction</a> elements. It is always recommended that the IATI Organisation ID is added (if possible) and the organisation’s name.</p>

<p class="">The current list of publishers can be found on the <a href="https://iatiregistry.org/publisher">IATI Registry.</a></p></dd>

<h2>Where can activity participants can be published?</h2>
<p><strong>Organisation file:</strong></p>
<p>Each organisation file must specify which organisation is publishing the file, and which organisation the data is about. In most cases, the publishing organisation is publishing data about itself. The organisation file can also include external organisations to which the publisher is providing core funding.</p>
<ul>
<li>In most cases, an organisation file will be from the perspective of one organisation. Guidance on publishing from the perspective of multiple organisations is coming soon.</li>
<li>It is always recommended that the IATI Org ID and the organisation’s name is included.</li>
