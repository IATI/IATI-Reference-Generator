<h1>IATI traceability guidance</h1>
<p>The inclusion of specific data within IATI activities allows users to trace the flow of funds from the original donors down to the intended beneficiaries. Delivery chains can be long and complex. For example:</p>
<dd>
<p class=""><em>Several donors might contribute to a multi-donor trust fund, which contracts a series of international NGOs, who in turn use local NGO partners, who then hire local contractors to deliver services.</em></p></dd>
<a href="/media/original_images/traceability_diagram_1.png"><img alt="../_images/traceability_diagram_1.png" src="/media/original_images/traceability_diagram_1.png"/></a>
<p>Each organisation needs to publish to IATI and link their data with their partners. Publishers should include who they are giving funding to, and who they are receiving funding from. They should also include references to the related activities their partners have published. As each activity has a unique IATI Activity Identifier, this identifier can be referenced by partner organisations.</p>
<p>When all publishers include the unique IATI Activity Identifier in their publishing, data users can identify the related activities, find partners working on the same activity and track the flow of funds both up and down the delivery chain. This is traceability. For example:</p>
<dd>
<p class=""><em>If Organisation A gives Organisation B £500 as part of their activity A1, Organisation B should publish a receipt of the £500 from Organisation A. Organisation B should include a reference to activity A1, showing the activity their funding came from. This allows data users to track the flow of funds through the delivery chain.</em></p></dd>
<a href="/media/original_images/traceability_diagram_2.png"><img alt="../_images/traceability_diagram_2.png" src="/media/original_images/traceability_diagram_2.png"/></a>
<p>Achieving traceability across all IATI data requires every publisher to include data on the organisation(s) and activity(s) from which their funding is coming from and, where possible, going to.</p>
<p id="types-of-identifiers">
<h2>Types of identifiers</h2>
<p>Each organisation publishing to IATI will have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="/en/guidance/publishing-data/registering-and-managing-your-organisation-account/how-to-create-your-iati-organisation-identifier/">IATI Organisation Identifier</a></p>
<p>This is a unique identifier for their organisation e.g. <a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?reporting_ref=XM-DAC-41114#view=main/">XM-DAC-41114</a> for the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). View the list of all IATI Organisation Identifiers <a href="https://www.iatiregistry.org/publisher">here</a></p>
</li>
<li><p><a href="/en/guidance/standard-overview/preparing-your-data/activity-information/creating-iati-identifiers/">IATI Activity Identifier</a></p>
<p>Every IATI activity has a unique identifier. This is formed of the publishing organisation’s IATI Organisation Identifier followed by a unique code e.g. XM-DAC-41114-<a href="http://d-portal.org/ctrack.html?reporting_ref=XM-DAC-41114#view=act&amp;aid=XM-DAC-41114-OUTPUT-00114444">OUTPUT-00114444</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="using-identifiers">
<h2>Using identifiers</h2>
<p>If you are receiving funds from an organisation already publishing to IATI, you are expected to include their IATI Organisation Identifier and the unique IATI Activity Identifier from which they are providing the funds. For further help, see the <a href="/en/guidance/publishing-data/data-quality-and-visualisation/finding-other-organisations-identifiers/">Finding other organisations’ identifiers</a> page.</p>
<p>If you are providing funds to a downstream partner, the IATI Organisation Identifier for this organisation should also be included. If the partner organisation is not yet publishing to IATI, you should just include their name.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Include the participating organisations</strong></li>
</ol>
<dd>
<p class=""><p>Each organisation involved in the activity (funding, accountable, extending or implementing) should be listed.</p>
<p>The level of detail for each participating organisation will depend on where in the network they are or also any confidentiality concerns. You should provide as much information as possible from the full list below that is available to you at the time of publishing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Name</li>
<li>Organisation <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/organisationtype/">type</a></li>
<li>Organisation <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/codelists/organisationrole/">role</a></li>

<h2>Enhancing traceability</h2>
<p><strong>For transactions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Each transaction should reference the single provider and/or receiver of funds. This allows the transaction to be linked to either the external provider or receiver’s corresponding activity.</li>
<li>In most cases, the provider of a transaction will be different to the receiver. There are exceptions where you will be presenting the internal flow of funds (e.g. core funding) - then the provider and receiver might be the same.</li>
<li>For incoming transactions the reporting organisation should list the provider organisation/s it is receiving funding from. You should use the name and IATI Organisation Identifier the provider organisation publishes under, even if this is different to how you refer to them. For example, you may receive funding from a specific ministry or department, but your provider publishes as an entire organisation or government.</li>
<li>Disaggregated transactions enable traceability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>For identifiers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you don’t know the activity identifier for an organisation’s activity, you should still add their IATI Organisation Identifier (if known) and always add their name.</li>
<li>If an organisation is not yet publishing to IATI, and you are not able to obtain their identifier, then just the name and type of organisation should be included.</li>
<li>If you are receiving funds from a donor, ask them for the IATI activity identifier for the specific project or activity. If you are a donor, please provide your downstream partners with your IATI activity identifier for the project or activity.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The same transaction traceability elements should be added for <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/planned-disbursement/">planned disbursements</a>.</li>
<li>The <a href="../organisation-budgets-spend/"><span>total annual budget</span></a> for funding provided to each receiver-org should be added to the reporting org’s <a href="/en/guidance/standard-overview/preparing-your-data/organisation-infromation/">Organisation File</a>.</li>
