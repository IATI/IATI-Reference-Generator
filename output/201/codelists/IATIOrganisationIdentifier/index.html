<h1>IATI Organisation Identifier</h1>
<p>This is a list of organisation identifiers that is maintained by the IATI Secretariat.
The prefix for organisations on this list is XI-IATI</p>
<p>If a bona fide organisation is not registered with any recognised or appropriate registration agency (<a href="/en/iati-standard/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/">http://iatistandard.org/202/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/</a>) they should contact the IATI Technical Team who will exceptionally allocate an organisation identifier using the XI-IATI prefix.</p>
<p>While some of these identifiers have been derived from DAC codes, this ‘meaning’ is not carried forward. i.e. IATI generated identifiers have no intrinsic meaning.</p>
<p>For general guidance about constructing Organisation Identifiers, please see <a href="/en/guidance/publishing-data/registering-and-managing-your-organisation-account/how-to-create-your-iati-organisation-identifier/">http://iatistandard.org/organisation-identifiers/</a></p>
