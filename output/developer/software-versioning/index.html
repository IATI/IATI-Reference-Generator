<h1>IATI Software Versioning Protocol</h1>
<p>Beginning with the release of the first version of the IATI Validator (September 2020) to be adopted across our products, we version software in the common three element format - Major.Minor.Patch.
We adopt this form, following as closely as possible the rules defined at <a href="https://semver.org/">Semantic Versioning 2.0.0</a></p>
<p>In addition, we add a layer of meaning in regard to communication, illustrated in the table below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr><th></th>
<th><p>Major</p></th>
<th><p>Minor</p></th>
<th><p>Patch</p></th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Communicate Externally</strong></td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
<tr><td><strong>Consult Externally</strong></td>
<td>Yes</td>
<td>No</td>
<td>No</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>In other words:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>If a change is a Major Version bump, it requires us to consult with the external community</strong>, for example 1.0.0 to 2.0.0. This might include a major change to a UI or breaking changes to a public facing API.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If a change is a Minor Version bump, it requires us to publish a notification of changes externally</strong>, for example 1.0.0 to 1.1.0. This might include minor changes to a UI or non-breaking functional changes to a public facing API, for example the addition of a parameter.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>If a change is a Patch, it does not require external communication</strong>, for example 1.0.1 to 1.0.2. This would include bug fixes and other changes that make no functional difference.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Details of all code changes are available in GitHub Releases for each repository:</p>
