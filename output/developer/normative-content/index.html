<h1>IATI Normative and Non-normative content</h1>
<p><strong>Normative:</strong> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative#Standards_documents">Normative content</a> is the prescriptive part of a standard. It sets the rules to be followed in order to be evaluated as compliant with the standard, and from which no deviation is permitted.</p>
<p>The following content is considered normative:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT">IATI SSOT</a></p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists">IATI-Codelists</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets">IATI-Rulesets</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas">IATI-Schemas</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded">IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded</a></p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Non-normative:</strong> Non-normative content is the non-prescriptive, or ‘descriptive’, part of a standard. This may include analogies, synonyms, explanations, illustrations, context, and examples. In the event non-normative content contradicts normative content, the normative content is to be followed. The following content is considered non-normative:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation">IATI-Extra-Documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance">IATI Guidance</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Developer-Documentation">IATI-Developer-Documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Upgrades">IATI-Upgrades</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the non-normative content listed above that is related to the standard and managed on Github, IATI also provides <a href="/en/guidance">how to publish guidance</a> (managed on Wagtail) which also falls under this category.</p>
