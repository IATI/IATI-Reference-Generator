<h1>Security considerations</h1>
<p>When building tools for IATI data there are several security issues to be aware of.</p>
<section id="xml">
<h2>XML</h2>
<p>When parsing XML, you should be aware of entity based attacks.</p>
</section>
<section id="user-supplied-files">
<h2>User Supplied Files</h2>
<p>You should make sure that:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>user supplied files aren’t executable (e.g. if a PHP file is uploaded to the web directory)</p></li>
</ul>
<section id="fetching-remote-files">
<h3>Fetching Remote Files</h3>
<p>Working with IATI Data often involves fetching data from arbitrary URLs. You should check:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>the URLs don’t begin <a href="file://">file://</a> as this will expose data on the local filesystem</p></li>
<li><p>the URLs don’t point at any sensitive local HTTP(S) services</p></li>
</ul>
