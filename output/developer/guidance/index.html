<p>There are different ways to access and use IATI data. We recommend that developers use the IATI Datastore when creating new IATI tools, because it has updated and curated data. The Datastore documentation is <a href="https://iatidatastore.iatistandard.org/documentation/introduction">here</a>.</p>
<p>The IATI Registry also offers a CKAN API, but this data is not curated and includes datasets from deprecated versions of the IATI Standard. Therefore, we recommend that the CKAN API is used mainly for data entry. For more information on using the IATI Registry, see the <a href="/en/using-data/iati-tools-and-resources/using-iati-registry/">Using the IATI Registry page</a>. The documentation for CKAN is <a href="https://docs.ckan.org/">here</a>.</p>
<p>The IATI Validator allows for checks on the validity of IATI files, ensuring that they follow schemas, codelists and rulesets of the IATI Standard. Documentation for the IATI Validator is <a href="https://iativalidator.iatistandard.org/about">here</a>.</p>
