<h1>IATI Standard (Single Source of Truth)</h1>
<p>This documentation is about how the standard is stored and versioned. For the actual text of the standard, please see <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/">https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/activity-standard/</a> and <a href="/en/iati-standard/203/organisation-standard/">https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/203/organisation-standard/</a></p>
<p>As of 1.04, the IATI Documentation of the IATI Standard is built from a “Single Source of Truth” (SSOT), which consists of several GitHub repositories.</p>
<section id="repositories">
<h2>Repositories</h2>
<ul>
<li><dl>
<dt><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT">IATI-Standard-SSOT</a> the main SSOT repository, which contains the following as submodules:</dt><dd><ul>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation">IATI-Extra-Documentation</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas">IATI-Schemas</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists">IATI-Codelists</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets">IATI-Rulesets</a></p></li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition there are codelists in another repository <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded">IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded</a> which are not Embedded, that is any changes to them do not need to go through the Update process. Since it is versioned seperately, this is not a submodule of the IATI-Standard-SSOT repository.</p>
<p>The documentation on <a href="/en/iati-standard/">https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/</a> is then built from the contents of these repositories, plus <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Upgrades">IATI-Upgrades</a> which is not specific to a particular version of the Standard. Standard guidance and Developer documentation contained in <a href="/en/guidance/">https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/</a> is pulled from a further two, non-version specific repositories: <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance">IATI-Guidance</a> and <a href="https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Developer-Documentation">IATI-Developer-Documentation</a>.</p>

<section id="finding-a-specific-version-of-the-ssot">
<h2>Finding a specific version of the SSOT</h2>
<p>This can be done via:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>branches, which may change for typos and bugfixes e.g. <code>version-1.04</code></p></li>
<li><p>tags, which point to the exact commit on the day of release e.g. <code>v1.04</code></p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="versions-prior-to-1-04">
<h2>Versions prior to 1.04</h2>
<p>Prior to 1.04 the only github repository was IATI-Schemas, so this is the only repository with tags and branches for 1.01, 1.02 and 1.03.</p>
