<h1>Organisations</h1>
<p id="definition">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>Within the <strong>IATI activity standard</strong> <em>organisations</em> can be declared in three ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>reporting-org</code> - the organisation publishing the activity file and associated data.</li>
<li><code>participating-org</code> - the organisation that has a role within the activity (there can be various roles)</li>
<li><code>provider-org</code> / <code>receiver-org</code> - the organisation in providing or receiving a specific <code>transaction</code></li>
</ul>
</p>
<p id="considerations">
<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>When using the <strong>IATI activity standard</strong> to declare <em>organisations</em>, the following should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>In many cases, an activity file will contain information from the perspective of a single organisation.  Most commonly, this will be the same as the <code>reporting-org</code></li>
<li>It is also expected that this organisation would be cited as a <code>participating-org</code>, along with their associated role(s).</li>
<li>It is possible for multiple <code>participating-org</code> to be reported within a single activity.</li>
<li>Multiple <code>participating-org</code> with the same <code>OrganisationRole</code> code are also feasible.</li>
<li>For <code>reporting-org</code> and <code>participating-org</code> inclusion of the <code>OrganisationType</code> code is recommended.</li>
<li>In all cases, when describing an organisation, reference to their associated unique identifier should be included.</li>
<li>Should a <code>provider-org</code> or <code>receiver-org</code> within a <code>transaction</code> be the same as the <code>reporting-org</code> it is not expected that they are declared, but recommended.</li>
</ul>
