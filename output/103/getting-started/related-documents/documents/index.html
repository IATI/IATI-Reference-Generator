<p>This page is currently flagged for review. We are undertaking an update of the information we publish about the IATI Standard, and the content here has not yet been checked.</p>
<p>Which documents an organisation chooses to publish is very much down to the organisation itself. At the organisation level, this will be documents that provide greater context to users about the organisation and how it operates. For example, this may include annual reports, business plans and strategic reports, etc.</p>
<p>At the activity level, these will be documents that relate to that specific activity, such as project reports, appraisal documents, results papers, etc.</p>
