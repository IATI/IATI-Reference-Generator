<p>The format for reporting is very important in order for files to validate against the IATI Standard. IATI provides a standardised format for the reporting of activity data so that data can be easily extracted and compared across multiple reporting organisations. As such particular technical formats are required such as character encoding and specific date formats.</p>
<p>This section provides guidance on using the appropriate character encoding and date formats.</p>
