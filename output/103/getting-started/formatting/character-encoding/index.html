<h1>Character Encoding</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>IATI strongly recommends the use of the Unicode UTF-8 or UTF-16 character encodings to provide support for the widest range of languages.  These encodings may be declared at the beginning of XML documents as follows:</p>
<p><code>&lt;?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-8”?&gt;</code><br/>
or<br/>
<code>&lt;?xml version=”1.0” encoding=”UTF-16”?&gt;</code></p>
<p>The XML standard requires all conformant software to support both of these encodings, so the choice is up to the publisher.  In most cases, UTF-8 should result in smaller documents even for non-alphabetic languages like Han Chinese, since much of an IATI document consists of XML markup, (alphabetic) codes, and numeric values.</p>
<p>IATI discourages the use of non-Unicode character encodings such as “BIG5” or “ISO-8859-1”, since these might not be supported by all XML processing software, and the Initiative’s goal is maximum transparency and portability.</p>
