<h1>Publishing Data</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>Data is published on the IATI Registry in XML format. This is a computer readable language and existing data that is mapped to IATI requirements will need to be converted into this format. A publisher account will need to be set up on the IATI Registry so that you can publish the URL addresses for your data and edit and/or update information as required.</p>
<p>It should be noted that the data files themselves are not stored on the IATI Registry (these must be published on your own site) but it provides access to published files through storing the links to each publisherâ€™s files.</p>
