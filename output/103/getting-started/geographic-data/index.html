<h1>Geopolitical Information</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>It is essential that each activity contains some geographic data, whether this is a country or region. Multiple countries (or regions) can be reported in an activity, but where this is the case each should be assigned a percentage to identify how much of the activity is taking place in that country. It is also important to ensure that the sum of these percentages equals 100%. This section provides more information on reporting geographical information, including at a sub-national level such as geocoding.</p>
<p>Geocoding is an optional element, but should be provided if available as sub-national geographic information is useful to partner countries in understanding how funding is disbursed.</p>
<h3>Jurisdictions and Geography</h3>
<p>IATI activity reports provide two different mechanisms for determining where aid money is being spent:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Geographical</strong> (dealing with specific locations or areas).</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdictional</strong> (dealing with governments or groups of governments).</li>
</ul>
