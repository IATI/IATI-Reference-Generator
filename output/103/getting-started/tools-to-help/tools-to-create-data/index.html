<h1>Tools to Create Data</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>There are a two <strong>third-party</strong> tools available for use in converting / publishing IATI data.</p>
<h3>Web-entry platforms</h3>
<p>There are currently two web-entry platforms that can be used to publish data:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AidStream</strong>: <a href="http://aidstream.org/public/">http://aidstream.org/public/</a> </li>
<li><strong>Open Aid Register</strong>: <a href="http://www.openaidregister.org/">http://www.openaidregister.org/</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The web-entry platforms act as online project management systems or data bases, whereby information is entered manually in the form or text-based information or selecting responses from drop-down menus. This covers all of the activity information required by IATI and will automatically convert the data into XML and provide the appropriate links to register the files on the IATI registry.</p>
<h3>Spreadsheet conversion tool</h3>
<p>The spreadsheet conversion tool can be used to convert data stored in a CSV file by mapping the columns in the data to IATI fields. The tool will pull out the information and convert it into XML data. This can also be used for organisations reporting on CRS data, as long as it is captured in a spreadsheet.<br/>
There are certain preconditions for using the tool: the data must use IATI codelists, be formatted according to IATI Standard specifications (e.g., dates must be in the format YYYY-MM-DD) and be contained in a single worksheet.<br/>
The tool also has several limitations. It does not permit a hierarchy of activities, or multiplicity within more than one dimension (e.g. multiple sectors and multiple recipient countries).<br/>
Finally, the tool does not currently provide any verification of compliance with the Standard.<br/>
You can access the tool here: <a href="http://csv2iati.iatistandard.org/">http://csv2iati.iatistandard.org/</a></p>
