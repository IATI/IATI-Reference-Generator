<h1>Technical Issues</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>There are a number of technical issues that an organisation may need to consider when working towards IATI publication. </p>
<p>These include looking at <a href="data-architecture/">how data is currently collected and stored</a> and how easy it is to pull together (e.g. whether it can automatically feed into an IATI reporting system or if it needs to be pulled from different sources).</p>
<p>Another consideration is around <a href="in-house-capacity/">in-house capacity</a> and expertise (i.e. whether an organisation has the ability to convert their data into IATI format using internal systems or technical capacity), or whether third party tools need to be used.</p>
