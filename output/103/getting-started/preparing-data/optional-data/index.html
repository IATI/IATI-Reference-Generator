<h1>Optional Data</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>There are currently three elements in the IATI Standard which are considered optional. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/103/activities-standard/geopolitical-information/sub-national-geo-location">Sub-national Geographic Location</a></li>
<li><a href="../../../activities-standard/conditions/">Text of Conditions</a></li>
<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/103/activities-standard/performance/results">Results data</a></li>
</ul>
<p>These remain optional at present as, although some organisations are publishing information under these areas, it is recognised that not all organisations capture this data, or at least not in a standardised, easily accessible format. Organisations may need to do additional work or change their data capture approach in order to capture and/or report this type of data.</p>
<p>The aim however, is for organisations to publish information relevant to these areas at some point in their future publications if it is not already available.</p>
