<p>Much of the traceability in IATI is enabled through identifying the organisations involved and as such being able to trace the flow of funds between them. For reporting organisations which are not listed in the code lists in IATI, they will need to generate an organisation identifier following a set of rules. For those organisations who are listed or are existing publishers, there organisation identifiers can also be provided in the activities of other organisations when making reference to them in participating organisation roles.</p>
<p>This section outlines how to generate an organisation identifier and how to report participating organisations. It also sets out how to provide contact information for the activity.</p>
