<p>As part of the process for implementing IATI sustainably within an organisation, many organisations took the approach of forming a working group, in order to bring together all the relevant parts of the organisation. In most situations this group was formed early in the process of working on IATI implementation, to integrate the ideas and practical plans for publishing IATI data.<br/>
Working Groups are generally made up by staff from the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Programmes</li>
<li>Finance</li>
<li>IT and Information Management</li>
<li>Legal</li>
</ul>
<p>The Working Group ensures that the detailed processes for capturing and publishing data are properly integrated and function smoothly throughout an organisation, bringing together different departments.</p>
<p>Another process to consider when implementing IATI is the need for change management. This is particularly important for organisations that want to invest in implementing IATI, and ensure that it becomes an integral part of the organisation’s information capture, collection and publishing infrastructure. The UK’s Department for International Development, the first organisation to publish to the Standard, made a strong commitment to change management. They engaged in a series of presentations to staff at all levels, creating posters to increase awareness of transparency, for example promoting the importance of writing documents, keeping in mind that they may be published in the public domain, rather than remain internal. The focus was on changing the mindset of staff in their everyday work, rather than viewing IATI as another reporting mechanism.  </p>
