<p>The Implementation is in an Excel spreadsheet format. The first tab is an instruction page and is also where the organisation name and version number is provided. The second tab covers publisher information, which outlines areas such as timeliness and frequency of data publication, what the organisationâ€™s unit of aid is, any exclusions or thresholds set, and licensing arrangements. This section can also be used to complete the publisher profile when a publisher account is set up on the IATI Registry.</p>
<p>The third and fourth tabs cover the elements within the IATI Standard itself, referring to both the organisation standard and the activity standard. This enables organisations to provide further information against each element within the standard, identifying when the data for each is likely to be published (e.g. full compliance at a given date, future publication, or not publishing that data) and any exclusions that have been set around it (also identifying any data not being published as it is not applicable to the organisation). It also allows organisations to map their own data definitions to the IATI standard definition and add any notes regarding the publishing activity (e.g. to provide further clarification around omissions).</p>
<p>The Implementation Schedule is a living document (hence the version control) which can be updated and added to at any time, to reflect changes or additions to the way an organisation is reporting. Although the drafting of the Implementation Schedule can be done in parallel with preparing data for publication, the Implementation Schedule should be submitted for publication prior to the publication of data. It is the Implementation Schedule that informs users of what information an organisation is publishing and what is not being published and the reasons behind this. To this end, the Implementation Schedule can be used as both an internal mapping tool to aid organisation in planning their implementation, and as a source of information to data users to better understand the data.</p>
