<h1>The IATI Activities Standard</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>The <strong>activity standard</strong> is designed for reporting the details of <strong>individual aid activities</strong>. An activity is defined by the reporting organisation – depending on who is reporting, it might be a large programme, a small project or another logical grouping of work and resources.</p>
<p>The activity standard is the most <strong>widely used part of IATI</strong>. A reporting organisation will typically produce one IATI activity file per country or geographical region.</p>
<p>The standard supports around <a href="overview/">forty different fields</a>, referenced by standard code lists, and designed to capture information about many different kinds of aid activities.</p>
<h3>What information is inside an IATI activity?</h3>
<p>An IATI activity can answer some or all of the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the name and description of the activity?</li>
<li>Who is involved, and what is their role?</li>
<li>Where is the activity geographically?</li>
<li>When is/did the activity taking place?</li>
<li>What documents help us find out more?</li>
<li>How is the activity classified and categorised?</li>
<li>What are the activity’s financial details, including transactions over time?</li>
<li>What are the expected and actual results?</li>
</ul>
<p>Organisations publish IATI activities within an IATI XML Activity File.  A file can detail one or many activities, and a organisation can publish one or many files.  It is expected that these files are updated as activities progress, and are made available via the <a href="http://iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a>.</p>
