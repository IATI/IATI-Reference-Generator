<p><h2>&lt;iati-activities&gt;&lt;/iati-activities&gt;</h2><p><h3>From the schema</h3><p>
        Top-level list of one or more IATI activity records.
      </p><table><tbody><tr><td>@version</td><td>
            A number indicating the IATI specification version in use.
          </td></tr><tr><td>@generated-datetime</td><td>
            A date/time stamp for when this file was generated.  This
            is not necessarily the last-updated date for the
            individual activity records in it.  Uses ISO 8601 date
            format, e.g. "2010-03-12T18:45:00+01:00".  Use of this
            attribute is highly recommended, to allow recipients to
            know when a file has been updated.
          </td></tr><tr><td>@linked-data-default</td><td>
            IATI publishers are not obliged to publish their own
            Linked Data.  However, if a publisher chooses to publish
            linked data about their IATI activities then allowing them
            to declare where this data is published would support
            discovery of it, and any additional information they may
            choose to publish as Linked Data alongside it.
            
            This attribute is URI path upon which an activity
            identifier can be appended to get a dereferenceable URI
            for any activity contained within a file.
            
            Where a publisher declares using one of these properties
            that authoritative linked data is accessible for an
            activity then consuming applications that are generating
            Linked Data from an IATI XML file should assert an
            owl:sameAs relationship to the relevant URI.
