The unique organisation identifier for the receiver organisation. Some large organisations already have existing codes assigned through the OECD. For those organisations where no code exsits, the organisation can generate their own code for IATI use in the format of country-registration company-registration number. (e.g. the organisation identifier for DIPR is: <abbr title="Gigabyte">GB</abbr>-COH-06368740.)

Organisation IDs: It is now recommended that organisation ids are built to a convention, so the schema declaration that @ref must be on a codelist is out of date. A change to the schema must occur through our change control process. As such this is flagged for change.
