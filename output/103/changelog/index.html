<p>As the IATI Standard evolves, the documentation associated with the IATI Standard website also changes.  On this page we will keep a log of documentation changes.</p>
<h3>Version 1.02</h3>
<p><strong>Schema and codelist changes</strong><br/>
Where an element, attribute or codelist has changed, a statement has been appended to the relevant page.  For 1.02 these are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Addition of the @linked-data-default attribute on <a href="../activities-standard/iati-activities/">iati-activities element</a></li>
<li>Addition of the @linked-data-uri attribute on <a href="../activities-standard/iati-activity/">iati-activity element</a></li>

<p>Detailed specifications on the changes to the standard are published on the <a href="http://wiki.iatistandard.org/standard/revision/1.02/changes_specification?s[]=1&amp;s[]=02" title="Change specifications - 1.01 to 1.02">IATI wiki</a>. </p>
<p><strong>Documentation changes </strong><br/>
On the IATI Standard documentation, the navigation and page URL for the Activity Standard has been changed.  Previous versions included a nesting of pages around facets not used within the standard (Identification, Basic Activity Information, etc).  The Activity Standard is now organised in a flatter structure, for ease of navigation.  Additionally, the URL pattern has been edited to reflect the exact term for each element.  For example:</p>
<p>1.01: Sector: http://iatistandard.org/103/101/activities-standard/classifications/general-detailed-sector/<br/>
1.02: http://iatistandard.org/103/activities-standard/sector/</p>
<p>A full <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqXcKmXbCG-OdEQ4S1JvLUNLWm9JaldEbDJYci1EVGc">list of URL changes</a> is available. All URLs have been automatically redirected where possible.</p>
