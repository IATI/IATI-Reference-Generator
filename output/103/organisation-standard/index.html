<h1>The IATI Organisation Standard</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>The <strong>organisational standard</strong> is designed for reporting the total <strong>future budgets</strong> of organisations and<strong> forward planning</strong> budget data for recipient institutions and countries.</p>
<p>The organisation standard is used to describe one or more organisations (such as donors, foundations, agencies, or NGOs) involved in the aid delivery chain.  It is designed to report forward-looking aggregate budget information for the reported organisation’s, and planned <strong>future budgets</strong> to recipient institutions or countries.</p>
<p>The organisation standard <a href="org-overview/">consists of some 20 fields</a>.  Each of these have various attributes.  It is expected that every organisation publishing IATI data should include one organisation file, which is updated at least annually.</p>
<h3>What information is inside an IATI organisation file?</h3>
<p>The organisation standard helps organisations answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the organisation’s name and identifier?</li>
<li>What are the organisation’s planned future annual total budgets?</li>
<li>What are the organisation’s planned future budgets for aid given to recipient countries?</li>
<li>What are the organisation’s planned future budgets for aid given to recipient organisations?</li>
<li>Where are the organisation’s official public documents?</li>
</ul>
