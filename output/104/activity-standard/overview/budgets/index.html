<h1>Budgets</h1>
<p id="definition">
<h2>Definition</h2>
<p>The monetary <em>budgets</em> assigned to a specific <code>iati-activity</code> can be described in the <strong>IATI activity standard</strong> using the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>transaction-type</code> - <code>Commitment</code> type can be used to describe the total committed budget for the duration of the activity.</li>
<li><code>budget</code> - the value of the <code>iati-activity</code> <code>budget</code> for each financial year, as stated in the original project document.</li>
<li><code>planned-disbursement</code> - a scheduled payment, set up against the <code>budget</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there are two areas within the <strong>IATI activity standard</strong> that allow further clarification of budgets:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>country-budget-item</code> - alignment of <code>iati-activity</code> with the functional and administrative classifications used in the <code>recipient-country</code> Chart of Accounts.</li>
<li><code>capital-spend</code> - the percentage of the total commitment that is for capital spending.</li>
</ul>
<p>These all relate to the specific <code>iati-activity</code> being described.</p>
</p>

<h2>Considerations</h2>
<p>When using the <strong>IATI activity standard</strong> to declare <em>budgets</em>, the following should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is recommended that budgets are presented in financial years.</li>
<li>When presenting multiple budgets, then the <code>budget</code> element should be repeated accordingly.</li>
<li>It is expected that the financial years for <code>reporting-org</code> are described.</li>
<li>It is possible to report periods other than years, but this is not recommended.</li>
<li>Financial periods can be presented using the <code>period-start</code> and <code>period-end</code> dates.</li>
<li>For <code>planned-dibursement</code> it is valid to only report the <code>period-start</code> as a single date.</li>
<li>It is possible to report budget values in multiple currencies, overriding the default currency set in <code>iati-activity</code></li>
<li>It is expected that budgets would be described from the <code>reporting-org</code> perspective.</li>
<li>When declaring a <code>value-date</code> for any budget, this date must be in the past.</li>
</ul>
