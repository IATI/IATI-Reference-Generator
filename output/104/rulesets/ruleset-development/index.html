<h1>Ruleset development</h1>
<p>IATI rules and rulesets can be developed and deployed in a number of possible ways.</p>
<p id="different-types-of-rules">
<h2>Different types of rules</h2>
<p>So far, the Standard Ruleset deploys two types of rules:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Starts with</code> - conditions around the formation of the <code>iati-identifier</code></li>
<li><code>Date order</code> - logics around the ordering of various date elements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other rules are also possible /  feasible.</p>
</p>
<p id="making-new-rulesets">
<h2>Making new rulesets</h2>
<p>Individual rules can be used and re-used in various collections of Rulesets.</p>
<p>The Standard Ruleset could be extended by adding rules particular to a single publisher, to allow them, and others, to check the data they are producing matches a certain criteria.</p>
</p>
<p id="limitations-of-rulesets">
<h2>Limitations of rulesets</h2>
<p>Via the IATI Validator, Rulesets do not currently apply to an entire dataset, consisting of several files.  Hence, a ruleset cannot test if an activity identifer has been used once, and only once, by a publisher across their entire dataset.</p>
<p>Rulesets do not allow for checks such as whether or not supplied text contains meaningful information.</p>
<p>Rulesets do not check codes against codelists.</p>
