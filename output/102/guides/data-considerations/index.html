<h1>Data Considerations</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>One of the main considerations with data is how an activity is defined and reported. This requires a clear definition of an organisationâ€™s unit of aid (which will form the basis of activity reporting) and an understanding of how reporting will occur, with a particular focus on related activities (such as hierarchies) and segmentation of data (for example, whether activities will be segmented by country or region or presented in one file).</p>
<p>As one of the aims of IATI is to enable greater traceability of funds through the system, another important consideration is incorporating elements of traceability in the reporting. For example, the receipt of incoming funds should refer the organisation providing these funds and their identifier.</p>
<p>This section outlines how to define an activity, how to incorporate traceability and how to segment data files.</p>
