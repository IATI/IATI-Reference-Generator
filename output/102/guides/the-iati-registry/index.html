<h3>An introduction to the IATI Registry</h3>
<p>The IATI Registry is a repository of IATI data file links. It is not a database, but stores the URL links to XML data files organisations have published, and their associated metadata. In this way it acts very much like a library card system, directing users to the relevant organisationâ€™s site where the data is published.</p>
<h3>Using the IATI Registry:</h3>
<p>Data on the IATI Registry can be searched by publisher or data. Searching by publisher enables users to look through the list of publishing organisations and identify what files they are publishing. This can be used to demonstrate which organisations are publishing data and how many files they have published. Searching by data provides a more advanced search facility, whereby users can then filter the search by publisher, organisation type, country, and file type (organisation or activity). Individual files can then be downloaded for viewing (this will appear as XML data).</p>
