<p>This page is currently flagged for review. We are undertaking an update of the information we publish about the IATI Standard, and the content here has not yet been checked.</p>
<p>The ability to monitor and analyse activities by sector is one of the central deliverables of IATI data and thus a critical requirement for compliance with the standard.</p>
<h3>Vocabularies</h3>
<p>Three different classification systems of classification are in widespread use:</p>
<ul>
<li>The OECD Development Assistance Committee’s Creditor Reporting System Purpose Codes (CRS)</li>
<li>The UN Classifications of the Functions of Government (COFOG)</li>
<li>The US National Taxonomy of Exempt Entities (NTEE)</li>
</ul>
<p>IATI recommends the usage of CRS Codes, but allows for COFOG and NTEE classifications and will in future provide a service that cross-references these systems.</p>
<h3>Using your own Coding</h3>
<p>If you have your own classifications IATI recommends that you publish your own codes in addition to the CRS sectors. This maintains both the accuracy of your own system and compatibility with other publishers. You do this by specifying the vocabulary “RO: Reporting Organisation” .</p>
<pre>eg.

Basic education for all
Primary education

(NB. If no vocabulary is specified, DAC CRS is assumed.)</pre>
<h3>Reporting Multiple Sectors</h3>
<p>IATI allows for the reporting of multiple sectors to describe an activity best. This requires that you provide a percentage split <strong>in each vocabulary used</strong> between reported sectors (ensuring that these add up to 100%). This split should provide an estimate of how the costs of the activity are divided up.</p>
