<p>
<p>In order to publish data you will need to set up an account at the <strong><a href="http://www.iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a></strong>. This is a two-step process as in individual will first set up an admin account, and will then set up a publisher account. This step will be authorised by the technical team and you will then be able to publish your files.</p>
<p>When setting up a publisher account you will also need to create a publisher profile. Much of this covers the same information recorded in the publisher information tab of the Implementation Schedule. You will also need to select from the drop-down menu what sort of license you will be using (this should be either public domain or attribution only for IATI compliance).</p>
<p>Once you are registered you will be able to upload the links to XML files, either manually or through a bulk upload.  </p>
<p>Guidance is available on the Registry, but it entails filling in a template (provided on the Registry) with key details about each file from which the Registry can pull out the relevant information to be able to upload the file links.</p>
