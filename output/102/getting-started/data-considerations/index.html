<h1>Data Considerations</h1>

<p>
<p>When working towards publication, it is important to know what data you have available as an organisation and the quality of this data. The focus is very much on publishing what you can, based on what is readily available, ensuring it is of reasonable quality, and also taking into account any exclusions. The idea is to then continually improve over time. The Implementation Schedule should be used to identify the status of the data and set out plans for future publication (i.e. improvements and increasing data reporting areas).</p>
