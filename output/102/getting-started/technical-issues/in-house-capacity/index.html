<p>
<p>Organisations with internal technical expertise and capacity may decide to generate their own mechanisms for converting their data into IATI data. This can be in terms of developing systems which automatically pull the necessary information together and then converts it into the IATI format, or having technical experts who can convert data into XML. This can also extend to organisations acquiring the services of contractors to set up bespoke systems to capture IATI relevant data.</p>
<p>It is recognised that many organisations will not have this capacity, but for large organisations with a greater number of activities to report, it may be an area worth considering to enable to automatic draw-down of IATI data.</p>
