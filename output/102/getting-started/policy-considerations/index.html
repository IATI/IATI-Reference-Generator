<h1>Policy Considerations</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>The Implementation of IATI is most often carried out by a team of staff representing several areas of an organisation, including finance, IT and programmes.<br/>
However, many of the organisations that have already published have found that the more detailed technical work was necessarily preceded by a series of higher level policy considerations and decisions that shape the implementation within the organisation.</p>
<p>This section of the website outlines some of these key areas that may need to be considered at a policy level.</p>
