<p>IATI requires data published to the Standard to be compliant as either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Public Domain</strong> – no copyright, database rights or contractual rights exist over the data that has been published by an organisation. Examples include the Creative Commons’ CC0 tool and the Open Data Commons Public Domain Dedication and Licence (PDDL). You can access an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nHvDx2JN5qc07vszHKc6Ow1eSEyo02YrbFFR9Y5sQVU/edit?authkey=CLv0h88D&amp;authkey=CLv0h88D">example IATI Public Domain licence</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Attribution-Only</strong> – licenses that allow for use and reuse of the data, with the only restriction being that attribution (credit) be given to the organisation that has published the data. Examples include the Creative Commons’ Attribution Licenses (CC-BY) and the Open Data Commons Attribution Licence. You can access an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oXATsAI8zhwYM4gI8RpUs8z4KyUCXgKa67b3KJ2-jUA/edit?authkey=CPr8jqMP&amp;authkey=CPr8jqMP">example IATI Attribution-Only licence</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic templates for both kinds of license are also available on the Open Data Commons website: <a href="http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/">http://opendatacommons.org/licenses/</a></p>
<p>There are several considerations that should be taken into account when considering what licence an organisation should use on their IATI data:</p>
<ol>
<li>Review the existing licenses or legal conditions regarding data sharing within an organisation.</li>
<li>Consult the IATI Standard requirements for licensing data, and decide which is most appropriate for the organisation.</li>
<li>Refer to templates available for IATI licenses, and manipulate to suit specific organisational needs.</li>
<li>Consult with the IATI TAG Secretariat or a licensing specialist if you are uncertain whether the license you have created is IATI compliant.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you have any further detailed questions regarding licensing of IATI data, you can contact the IATI Secretariat directly or through the Knowledge Base, who may put organisations in touch with an Open Data Licensing Specialist if necessary.</p>
