<p>
<p>Viewing and accessing IATI data can be undertaken through the following sources:</p>
<h3>IATI Registry</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://iatiregistry.org/">IATI Registry</a></strong> is the central resource of links to all data published to the IATI standard.  Via the Registry it is possible to search datasets by publisher, type and country.  When using the Registry, it is also possible to “preview” individual data sets.  On accessing this, a version of the data is made available, that is accessible within a web browser.</p>
<h3>IATI Explorer</h3>
<p>The <strong><a href="http://iatiexplorer.org/">IATI Explorer</a></strong> is a tool provided by <a href="http://www.developmentgateway.org/">Development Gateway</a>.  This tool enables people to search, query, access and download data across IATI.</p>
<h3>AidView Beta</h3>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.aidview.net/">AidView</a></strong> visualises IATI datasets via an interactive “app”. This enables people to search and query IATI data from multiple viewpoints, and access the data as a graph, list or map.</p>
