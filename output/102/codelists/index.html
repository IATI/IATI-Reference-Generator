<h1>Code Lists</h1>

<p>
<p>The<strong> IATI codelists</strong> are key to making IATI activity and organisation data from different publishers <strong>comparable</strong>. Numerical codes are used to represent many standard values in an IATI file – for example, organisation types such as “Government” or “National NGO”. Standard sector codes and organisational identifiers are also supported.</p>
<p>The IATI codelists ensure activity and organisation information is <strong>comparable between different publishers</strong>.</p>
<p>Codes for fields such as <a href="organisation_type/">organisation type </a> (e.g. 23 = Regional NGO; 60 = Foundation; or 70 = Private Sector) ensure that different publishers have unambiguous, comparable definitions they can use when describing aid activities.</p>
<p>The codes use existing authority lists where possible and build on codes published by the ISO, OECD DAC, COFOG and Guidestar.</p>
