<h1>The IATI Standard</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>There are three key components to the IATI Standard:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://iatistandard.org/standard/activities">The Activity Standard</a></li>
<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/203/organisation-standard/">The Organisation Standard</a></li>
<li><a href="http://iatistandard.org/standard/codelists">The IATI Codelists</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>activity standard</strong> is designed for reporting the details of <strong>individual aid activities</strong>. An activity is defined by the reporting organisation – depending on who is reporting, it might be a large programme, a small project or another logical grouping of work and resources.</p>
<p>The <strong>organisational standard</strong> is designed for reporting the total <strong>future budgets</strong> of organisations and<strong> forward planning</strong> budget data for recipient institutions and countries.</p>
<p>The<strong> IATI codelists</strong> are key to making IATI activity and organisation data from different publishers <strong>comparable</strong>. Numerical codes are used to represent many standard values in an IATI file – for example, organisation types such as “Government” or “National NGO”. Standard sector codes and organisational identifiers are also supported.</p>
<h3><strong>Inside The Activity Standard</strong></h3>

<p>The activity standard is the most <strong>widely used part of IATI</strong>. A reporting organisation will typically produce one IATI activity file per country or geographical region.</p>
<p>The standard supports around 40 different fields, referenced by standard codelists, and designed to capture information about many different kinds of aid activities.</p>

<h3><strong>Inside The Organisation Standard</strong></h3>
<p id="attachment_1234"><a href="/media/original_images/iati_web_graphic_org.png"><img alt="" src="/media/original_images/iati_web_graphic_org.png" title="iati_web_graphic_noborder_comp" width="500"/></a><p>What information is inside an IATI organisation file?</p></p>
<p>The organisation standard is used to describe a single organisation (such as a donor, foundation, agency, or NGO) involved in aid work. It is designed to report forward-looking aggregate budget information for the reporting organisation, and planned <strong>future budgets</strong> to recipient institutions or countries.</p>

<h3><strong>Inside The IATI Codelists</strong></h3>
<p id="attachment_1234"><a href="/media/original_images/iati_codelists_graphic_web.png"><img alt="" src="/media/original_images/iati_codelists_graphic_web.png" title="IATI Codelists" width="500"/></a><p>What are IATI Codelists?</p></p>
<p>The IATI codelists ensure activity and organisation information is <strong>comparable between different publishers</strong>. The codes use existing authority lists where possible and build on codes published by the ISO, OECD DAC, COFOG and Guidestar.</p>
