<h1>Organisation Registration Agency</h1>
<p>The values from this codelist are used to identify the particular list that an organisation identifier was drawn from. The codelist provides a register of known identifier lists, including national company registers, NGO directories and international and multilateral organisation lists - along with guidance and online resources to help locate the identifiers assigned to a specific organisation.</p>
<p>As of 17 July 2017 this list is maintained by the org-id.guide project. Data publishers can now search for and locate the relevant list for a particular organisation identifier using the <a href="http://org-id.guide/">org-id.guide website</a>. The full register of identifier sources is also available to download in <a href="http://org-id.guide/download.xml">XML</a>, <a href="http://org-id.guide/download.json">JSON</a> and <a href="http://org-id.guide/download.csv">CSV</a> formats.</p>
<p>IATI periodically replicates the codelist of identifier sources from org-id.guide, to assist those accessing IATI documentation. However, it is advised that the most up-to-date source is the <a href="http://org-id.guide/">org-id.guide project</a>.</p>
<p>If org-id.guide does not contain an entry for the kind of organisation you need to identify, you can make a request a new list is included in the register following the <a href="http://docs.org-id.guide/en/latest/contribute/">guidance</a> or by getting in touch with org-id.guide at: <a href="mailto:contact%40org-id.guide">contact<span>@</span>org-id<span>.</span>guide</a>.</p>

Once registered, companies receive a SIREN or SIRET number, which is a unique business identifier. This information is maintained by Infogreffe. Infogreffe provide a basic overview of company information for free, and bulk download of data for a fee. A note on identifiers: - A SIRET number is constituted by the SIREN number, plus the NIC code. - The SIREN number relates to a business, whereas a SIRET number relates to a specific geographically located establishment which will be owned by a business. - “A SIREN number is your unique French business identification number. This 9 digit number will be requested by all French administration when dealing with you.. It is a proof that you are a fully registered French business” [1] “The SIRET code/number is an INSEE code which allows the geographic identification of any French establishment or business. The 14-digit number consists of three parts: - first, the SIREN code of the business (or legal unit or person) that owns the unit represented by the SIRET code, - second, the NIC (French: Numéro interne de classement), is a sequential four-digit number unique to the establishment, - and finally, a check digit that verifies the entire SIRET number. For example, 732 829 320 00074 would refer to the seventh establishment of the business with SIREN number 732 829 320.” [2] “Registration is administered by local centres de formalités des entreprises ( CFE), which checks your application and submits details to the relevant agencies (for a small fee). The CFE will provide you with a form M0, which is for the creation of a company.” [3] “Creating a company requires that it is registered with the Trade and Companies Register (RCS).” [4] “WHAT SOURCE IS USED FOR INFORMATION AVAILABLE ON THE INFOGREFFE WEBSITE?

The timeliness, availability, and licensing of this data varies among all 50 states. There is no federal dataset that contains all corporate registrations. It would be possible to create a unified open registry for all US corporations (even if only via aggregation from state ones) but this does not exist at this time.

An organisation will enjoy preferential tax treatment only after it has applied for and been granted approval as a PBO by the Commissioner, and continues to comply with the relevant prescribed requirements. ” [1] [1] <a href="http://www.sars.gov.za/AllDocs/OpsDocs/Guides/LAPD-IT-G16%20-%20Basic%20Guide%20to%20Income%20Tax%20for%20Public%20Benefit%20Organisations%20-%20External%20Guide.pdf">http://www.sars.gov.za/AllDocs/OpsDocs/Guides/LAPD-IT-G16%20-%20Basic%20Guide%20to%20Income%20Tax%20for%20Public%20Benefit%20Organisations%20-%20External%20Guide.pdf</a></td>
