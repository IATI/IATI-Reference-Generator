<h1>The IATI Activities Standard</h1>
</header><!-- .entry-header -->
<p>
<p>The <strong>activity standard</strong> is designed for reporting the details of <strong>individual aid activities</strong>. An activity is defined by the reporting organisation â€“ depending on who is reporting, it might be a large programme, a small project or another logical grouping of work and resources.</p>
<p>The activity standard is the most <strong>widely used part of IATI</strong>. A reporting organisation will typically produce one IATI activity file per country or geographical region.</p>
<p>The standard supports around <a href="overview/">forty different fields</a>, referenced by standard code lists, and designed to capture information about many different kinds of aid activities.</p>
<h3>What information is inside an IATI activity file?</h3>
