<h1>Previous upgrade process</h1>
<p>Over time the IATI Standard is upgraded, the changes to some or all of those parts of the standard are driven by the suggestions and experiences of the publishers and users of IATI data. The upgrade process below was used up to, and including, version 2.03 of the IATI standard.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: For information about the current upgrade process agreed at the IATI Members’ Assembly in 2017, please go to <a href="/en/iati-standard/upgrades/upgrade-changelogs/">Upgrades section of the IATI Standard website</a> .</p>
<section id="minor-changes">
<h2>Minor Changes</h2>
<p>Some changes can be made at any time without having a major effect on data publishers or data users. These are known as Minor Changes</p>
<p>Minor changes can be made without changing the version of the standard. They cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bug-fixes, including resolution of spelling and grammar errors (where there are no implications for usage and/or meaning)</p></li>
<li><p>modifications to non-embedded codelists</p></li>
<li><p>improvements to documentation</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Minor changes can be tracked through the <a href="https://github.com/IATI">IATI GitHub</a> account</p>
<p>More significant changes to the standard are handled via upgrades. There are two types of upgrades - Decimal Upgrades and Integer Upgrades.</p>
</section>
<section id="decimal-upgrades">
<h2>Decimal Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Decimal</strong> Upgrades (e.g. from 1.01 to 1.02) will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>bug-fixes, including resolution of spelling and grammar errors (where edits have implications for usage and/or meaning)</p></li>
<li><p>modifications to embedded codelists</p></li>
<li><p>minor additions to the standard which improve the functionality without introducing substantial new content</p></li>
<li><p>changes will be optional</p></li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="integer-upgrades">
<h2>Integer Upgrades</h2>
<p><strong>Integer</strong> Upgrades (e.g. from 1.x to 2.x) will cover:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>substantial additions involving new areas of data</p></li>
<li><p>new mandatory fields</p></li>
<li><p>changes that are not backwardly compatible</p></li>
<li><p>proposed minor upgrades that are disputed by one or more members.</p></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="open-consultation-on-all-proposed-changes">
<h2>Open Consultation on all proposed changes</h2>
<p>All proposed changes, for Integer and Decimal Upgrades, will be published on the IATI Knowledge Base in the <a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/categories/20001338-The-IATI-Standards">IATI Standards forums</a>.</p>
<p>The entire process should be open to public scrutiny at all times.</p>
<p>Anyone can make a proposal (via the <a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/forums/20020808-modifications-additions-improvements">Modifications, Additions, Improvements section</a>), and each upgrade process receives it’s own forum where proposals can be assigned. The forums allow for a public exchange on the merits of the proposals to take place. The IATI Technical Team will contribute to these exchanges and will draft proposals for the formal formats required for the standard.</p>
<p>Minor Changes may take place with or without wider consultation. You can suggest a minor change directly to <a href="mailto:support%40iatistandard.org">support<span>@</span>iatistandard<span>.</span>org</a></p>
<p>If you wish to discuss an idea before submitting a proposal you may wish to consult the <a href="http://wiki.iatistandard.org/community/mailing_list">IATI Technical Mailing List</a> first.</p>
