<h1>Upgrades</h1>
<p>The IATI standard is a living entity that requires improvement over time. The elements, attributes, rules and core codelist values can only be amended, added or removed during a formal upgrade.</p>
<p>See <a href="how-we-manage-the-standard/"><span>How we manage the standard</span></a> to find out more about our upgrade processes.</p>
<p>See <a href="upgrade-changelogs/"><span>Upgrade changelogs</span></a> to find out the changes made at each upgrade.</p>
<p>See <a href="guidance-updates/"><span>Guidance Updates</span></a> to find out how we make changes to our guidance documents that help explain the Standard.</p>
<section id="non-core-codelists">
<h2>Non-core codelists</h2>
<p>The only part of the Standard which can be updated outside of a formal upgrade are non-core codelists <a href="how-we-manage-the-standard/codelist-management/"><span>here</span></a>. These codelists are not version specific and additions or modifications have minor impact on already published data.</p>
<p>Often these codelists are replicas of codelists managed externally. IATI will keep the codelists up to date and log all changes made to a codelist e.g. when the ISO Country Codelist updated the country name Swaziland to eSwatini.</p>
<p>A changelog of the non-core codelists is available <a href="upgrade-changelogs/noncore-codelist-changelog/"><span>here</span></a>.</p>
