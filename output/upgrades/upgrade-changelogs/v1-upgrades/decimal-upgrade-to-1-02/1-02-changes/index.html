<h2>Documentation changes</h2>
<p>On the IATI Standard documentation, the navigation and page URL for the Activity Standard has been changed. Previous versions included a nesting of pages around facets not used within the standard (Identification, Basic Activity Information, etc). The Activity Standard is now organised in a flatter structure, for ease of navigation. Additionally, the URL pattern has been edited to reflect the exact term for each element. For example:</p>

<p>1.01: Sector: <a href="/en/iati-standard/101/activities-standard/classifications/general-detailed-sector/">https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/101/activities-standard/classifications/general-detailed-sector/</a></p>
<p>1.02: <a href="/en/iati-standard/102/activities-standard/sector/">https://iatistandard.org/en/iati-standard/102/activities-standard/sector/</a></p>

<p>A full <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AqXcKmXbCG-OdEQ4S1JvLUNLWm9JaldEbDJYci1EVGc">list of URL changes</a> is available. All URLs have been automatically redirected where possible.</p>
