<h1>Decimal Upgrade to 1.03</h1>

<p>The second decimal upgrade grade of the standard was proposed to occur during the spring of 2013, but faced delays that meant the timetable had to be revised. The process for doing so is outlined below.</p>
<p>Full proposals were worked up on the <a href="http://wiki.iatistandard.org/standard/revision/1.03/changes_specification">Changes Specification</a> page on the <a href="http://wiki.iatistandard.org/">wiki</a>.</p>
