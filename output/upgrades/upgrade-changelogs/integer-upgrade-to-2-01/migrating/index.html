<h2><a href="#id15">Overview</a></h2>
<p>This is an issue by issue guide for data publishers and data users of the IATI Standard.</p>
<p>It is aimed at people who are already familiar with the IATI Standard in it’s version 1.x form, and are looking to find out what has changed and how it may or may not affect them when creating or using data built to the 2.01 version of the IATI Standard.</p>
<p>It is recommended that you inspect each point in turn to decide if you need to take any action.</p>
<p>Readers of this document should not assume that the ordering of issues in the document implies a hierarchy of importance. Different data users/publishers will find some issues more relevant/important than others.</p>
<p id="organisation-and-activity-identifiers">
<h3><a href="#id16">Organisation and Activity Identifiers</a></h3>
<p><strong>What does version 2.01 of the IATI Standard require?</strong></p>
<p>IATI organisation identifiers should:</p>
<ul>
<li>be globally unique</li>
<li>be constructed from a consistent methodology</li>
<li>be compatible with other data standards</li>
</ul>
<p>Specifically, a valid organisation identifier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must start with a valid agency prefix</li>
<li>The agency prefix MUST be a valid code in the <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/">IATI OrganisationRegistrationAgency codelist</a></li>
<li>MUST only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphen, underscore, colon or period</li>
</ul>
<p>IATI activity identifiers</p>
<ul>
<li>must be globally unique</li>
<li>must be persistent</li>
<li>must be prefixed with an organisation identifier</li>
</ul>
<p>It should be recognised that IATI organisation identifiers can change over time. i.e. they CAN NOT be persistent.
Therefore when a reporting organisation’s identifier changes, the  previous reporting organisation identifier(s) should be reported in addition to the new one.</p>
<p>This will allow data users to continue to link activities to the organisation that reported them (because activity identifiers are constructed using the organisation identifier as part of the string, and once reported, an activity should maintain its original identifier).</p>
<p>In version 2.01 of the IATI Standard, therefore, we need a way to record the previous organisation identifier when this changes. We can do this using the <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a> element.</p>
<p>For information on the changes to that element see: <span>Update to other-identifier element</span></p>
<p>In addition:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALL publishers of IATI data MUST have a valid organisation identifier reported in reporting-org/@ref</li>
<li>When using the @ref attribute in participating-org/@ref, transaction/provider-org/@ref and transaction/receiver-org/@ref must be a valid organisation identifier. If you do not have one, then the narrative element may be used to describe the organisation.</li>
<li>The reporting-org element is MANDATORY.<ul>
<li>ALL the following rules must apply to the organisation-identifier in reporting-org/@ref</li>
<li>It is mandatory</li>
<li>The identifier MUST be the same as that recorded by the publisher on the IATI Registry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The iati-identifier is MANDATORY<ul>
<li>It MUST be globally unique among all activities published through the IATI Registry</li>
<li>Once an activity has been reported to IATI its identifier MUST NOT be changed in subsequent updates,</li>
<li>It MUST be prefixed with EITHER the organisation-identifier found in reporting-org/@ref OR a previous reporting-org identifier reported in <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a></li>
<li>The identifier MUST only contain alphanumeric characters and hyphen, underscore, colon or period</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest change is that all organisations must have an Organisation
Identifier that is prefixed with a valid code on the <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/codelists/OrganisationRegistrationAgency/">IATI OrganisationRegistrationAgency codelist</a></p>
<p>This means that a number of publishers will have to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Change their organisation identifier</li>
<li>Continue to report existing activities using the same activity identifier, but also report their previous Organisation Identifier using the <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a> element.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, if they wish to use IATI as their registration agency, they will need to agree their new identifier on the <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/codelists/IATIOrganisationIdentifier/">IATIOrganisationIdentifier codelist</a></p>
<p>Wherever @ref is used to talk about organisations in the standard, those references must be a valid organisation identifier (as defined above).</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>This is fundamental to the creation and use of IATI data and applies throughout the IATI Standard</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<p>While the schema will not be able to test for valid Organisation and Activity identifiers, it is possible to machine write tests to check for some compliance. However if your data does not meet these standards then it becomes difficult for others to use.</p>
</p>
<p id="update-to-other-identifier-element">
<h3><a href="#id17">Update to other-identifier element</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In versions 1.x of the IATI Standard the other-identifier element could be used to specify an alternative, non-IATI identifier for the activity.</p>
<p>In version 2.01 of the IATI Standard the definition of the element has changed to allow an number of types of alternative identifiers.</p>
<dl>
<dt>In version 2.01 of the IATI Standard the element has been re-constructed</dt>
<dd><ul>
<li>The @owner-ref and @owner-name attributes have been removed.</li>
<li>New attributes other-identifier/@type and other-identifier/@ref are added</li>
<li>The @type attribute is used to specify the type of identifier being given.</li>
<li>The @ref attribute is used for the identifier itself.</li>
<li>There is a child element <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/owner-org/">other-identifier/owner-org</a> where information about the organisation that crafted the identifier can be given. This field is set up so that multilingual text can be supplied,</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>In version 2.01 of the IATI Standard a new <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/codelists/OtherIdentifierType/">OtherIdentifierType</a> codelist is introduced.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>In the Activity schema</p>
<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>This change is in part to be able to deal with organisations changing their organisation identifiers. Because an iati-identifier needs to be unique and (once reported to IATI) will never change, and because it is constructed using an organisation identifier, when organisation identifiers change, data users still need to be able to relate activities to organisations.</p>
<p>To solve this, a previous reporting-org identifier can be reported in the
<a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a> element. This then allows us to require that an iati-identifier must be prefixed with:</p>
<ul>
<li>EITHER the organisation-identifier found in reporting-org/@ref</li>
<li>OR a previous reporting-org identifier reported in <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a></li>
</ul>
<p>For more information see:
<a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/52824355-Version-2-01-Iteration-3-9-Organisation-and-Activity-Identifiers">Organisation and Activity Identifiers</a> proposal on the support forum.</p>
<p>To make this element work, a new OtherIdentifierType codelist has been
constructed, and the entire element has been re-constructed.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>See: <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a></p>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Anyone reporting other-identifier in versions 1.x of the IATI Standard will need to reconstruct the way they report the data. They can continue to report the same data, but just need to reformat it.</li>
<li>Data users should be aware that parsing <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/other-identifier/">other-identifier</a> is different in 2.01.</li>
<li>Data publishers may take advantage of the opportunities to report other types of identifier that were not previously available to them.</li>
<li>Data may fail validation against the relevant 2.01 schema if the changes are not taken into consideration.</li>
</ul>

<p id="changes-introduced-between-versions-1-04-and-1-05-have-also-been-included-in-2-01">
<h3><a href="#id18">Changes introduced between versions 1.04 and 1.05 have also been included in 2.01</a></h3>
<p>As 2.01 of the IATI Standard was being prepared there was a decimal upgrade to version 1.05 that ran in parallel. All changes to the Standard between version 1.04 and 1.05 have been carried over into 2.01</p>
</p>
<p id="element-order">
<h3><a href="#id19">Element Order</a></h3>
<p><strong>What does version 2.01 of the IATI Standard require?</strong></p>
<p>Data elements must be published in the order specified by the schema.</p>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In versions 1.x of the IATI Standard, data elements could be published in any order and still be valid when checked against the relevant schema.</p>
<p>In 2.01 you MUST publish data elements in the order specified by the schema to pass schema validation.</p>
<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>By enforcing order on the schema we can also enforce the number of times certain elements may occur in the data. This should drive up data quality by making it easier for data publishers to know if they have got their data right using simple validation tests. While this will not cover all the complexities of the the IATI Standard, it will substantially increase the number of data elements than can be checked in this way.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>In both the Organisation and Activity Standards</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Element order can be found by:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/201/schema/">inspecting the schema directly</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Or via our GitHub repository:</p>

<li><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas/version-2.01/iati-common.xsd">Common schema</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The order is also reflected in the left hand <a href="/en/iati-standard/201/">navigation of the 2.01 website</a></p>
<p>Tables generated from the schema can be found at:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/201/organisation-standard/summary-table/">Organisation summary table</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<p>Data will fail validation against the relevant 2.01 schema.</p>

<h3><a href="#id24">Segmentation and file size</a></h3>
<p><strong>What does version 2.01 of the IATI Standard require?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>In order to ensure that all all IATI-XML files can be handled by all consuming systems it is proposed that a limit of 40MB is placed on the size of any single XML file.</li>
<li>Publishers are still encouraged to segment their data into meaningful chunks, BUT the guidance to segment by country is no longer necessarily considered to be best practice.</li>
<li>(NB the rule that the activity iati-identifier must be unique still applies. i.e. the same activity should not be reported in two different files by the same publisher)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>Previous guidance has been to segment data by country where possible/useful. This was an arbitrary decision.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<p>Files larger than 40MB are difficult for data users to use - even at 40MB this is still difficult for many users. If your files are too large it is possible that applications wanting to use your data may not be able to do so.</p>
</p>
<p id="free-text-fields">
<h3><a href="#id25">Free Text Fields</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In version 2.01 free text is handled very differently than it is in
versions 1.x</p>
<p>Every element in versions 1.x where free text can be supplied has
changed in version 2.01.</p>
<p>Text is no longer reported directly in the element itself, instead every
affected element gets a new ‘narrative’ child element, where the text
can be supplied. The narrative element can be repeated in order to
supply translations in different languages.  See <strong>Handling Translations</strong></p>
<p>There are many elements that contain data specified by a code value
where free text can no longer be supplied at all. See <strong>Descriptive text
is no longer allowed on data specified by codes (with some exceptions)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>The change has been made to improve how multilingual reporting can
occur, and to improve clarity where codes are reported.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>In both the Organisation and Activity Standards</p>
<p>Even where publishers do not supply translations of their text data,
they are still required to alter the way they report free text.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>How to declare a title</p>
<p>In 1.x</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;title&gt;Some title here&lt;/title&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>in 2.01</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;title&gt;
        &lt;narrative&gt;Some title here&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/title&gt;
</pre></code>

<p id="handling-translations">
<h3><a href="#id26">Handling Translations</a></h3>
<p><strong>What does version 2.01 of the IATI Standard require?</strong></p>
<p>The standard wants to allow publishers to easily declare multilingual translations for text data, and for data users to be able to easily access those translations. In 2.01 the way in which this done should make it easier for data users to handle.</p>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In version 1.x elements that allowed text to be declared (e.g. title) could be repeated for different languages.</p>
<p>In version 2.01 instead of repeating the parent element  (e.g. title) , those elements now have a &lt;narrative&gt; child element, which can repeated for different languages.</p>
<p>The narrative element uses the xlm:lang attribute to declare the language of the supplied text. If omitted then the text is assumed to be in the default language declared in the document root element.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>For a full list of elements where this now applies, see: Including nested, multi-lingual text elements for all elements containing free text in this post:

<h3><a href="#id27">Descriptive text is no longer allowed on data specified by codes (with some exceptions)</a></h3>
<p><strong>What does version 2.01 of the IATI Standard require?</strong></p>
<p>Where published data is defined by codes, the code is authoritative, and the associated look up value should not supplied.</p>
<p>There are two exceptions:  recipient-country and recipient-region, where descriptive text is allowed when a publishing organisation does not agree with the definition given by the ISO 3166-1 part of the ISO 3166 standard</p>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In version 1.x of the standard, a number of elements allowed the reporting of a code (usually in an attribute) and free text.  Where both a code and text was supplied it was impossible for a data user to know which field was authoritative.</p>
<p>In 2.01 the code is authoritative, and the ability to add free text has been removed from a number of elements.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>For a list of elements where this applies see:</p>
<p>Scrapping text of purely code elements -
<a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/52106219-Version-2-01-Iteration-3-4-Multi-lingual-text-fields">Multi-lingual text fields</a> on the support forum.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>In version 1.x this was allowed:</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;activity-status code="2" &gt;Implementing&lt;/activity-status&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>as was;</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;activity-status code="2" &gt;implementing&lt;/activity-status&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>and;</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;activity-status code="2" &gt;any text here&lt;/activity-status&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>and even;</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;activity-status code="2" &gt;Post Completion&lt;/activity-status&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>In version 2.01, all of the above would fail validation against the schema as text is not allowed at all in this element. To indicate an activity status of implementing you would simply declare:</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;activity-status code="2" /&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p><strong>Exceptions</strong></p>
<p>Both the recipient-region and recipient-country elements still allow both a code and descriptive text to be specified. This is to cover the cases where the organisation publishing the data may not agree with name of a country or region given by the lookup codelists IATI uses.</p>
<p>Data users should be aware that where the narrative element has been supplied then that publishers prefers the name supplied to be associated with it’s data.</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>To declare a recipient country of Kosovo, both of these are acceptable:</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;recipient-country code="XK" /&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<dl>
<dt>Here, a lookup against the relevant codelist (<a href="/en/iati-standard/201/codelists/Country/">Country</a>)</dt>
<dd>would return a country name of ‘Kosovo’</dd>
</dl>
<p>If you prefer to declare a different name that differs from the ISO 3166-1 part of the ISO 3166 standard  (e.g. Kosovo (As per UNSCR 1244)) then do this:</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;recipient-country code="XK"&gt;
        &lt;narrative&gt;Kosovo (As per UNSCR 1244)&lt;/narrative&gt;
&lt;/recipient-country&gt;

</ul>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>

<h3><a href="#id35">Formatting of Dates (and datetimes)</a></h3>
<p><strong>What does version 2.01 of the IATI Standard require?</strong></p>
<p>To ensure that IATI data can be utilised, dates and datetimes should be formatted in a consistent way.</p>
<p>In version 2.01 a date should be a valid xsd:date, and a datetimes
should be a valid xsd:dateTime</p>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In versions 1.x of the IATI Standard dates and date formats were specified with reference to ISO 8601 standard, and it was not always clear how that standard should be interpreted and used.</p>
<p>In version 2.01 a date should be a valid xsd:date, and a datetimes
should be a valid xsd:dateTime</p>
<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>In the past IATI has not given clear guidance about the specific formats of the ISO 8601 standard that can be used. It is clear that the data types built into the XML standard, xsd:date and xsd:dateTime, are both well suited and
sufficient for the needs of data publishers and data users.</p>
<p>By specifying this requirement, it also allows dates and datetimes in
the data to be easily validated.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>In both Activity and Organisation standard.</p>
<p>Wherever a date or a datetime is required (search the schema for xsd:date xsd:dateTime) it should be a valid value.</p>
<p>For most publishers their existing date/datetime data will be valid.
Testing your data against schema validation will easily show if your
dates need altering (re-formatting)</p>
<p>Affected attributes:</p>
<p>dates:</p>
<ul>
<li>all @iso-date attributes</li>
<li>fss/@extraction-date attribute</li>
<li>all @value-date attributes</li>
</ul>
<p>datetimes:</p>
<ul>
<li>all @generated-datetime attributes</li>
<li>all  @last-updated-datetime attributes</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>Examples of how this change works can be seen on (for example):</p>
<ul>
<li><ul>
<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/201/activity-standard/iati-activities/iati-activity/activity-date/">&lt;Activity standard - activity date</a></li>

<li><a href="/en/iati-standard/201/organisation-standard/iati-organisations/iati-organisation/total-budget/period-start/">&lt;Organisation standard - period start</a></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>

<h3><a href="#id36">URL validation</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>

data fields where a URL was expected was set as xsd:string.</p>
<p>In version 2.01 of the IATI Standard,  the schema data type used for
some data fields where a URL is expected is now set as xsd:anyURI</p>
<p><strong>Example</strong></p>
<p>‘website’ is a child element of contact-info.</p>
<p>In version 1.x the following would validate against the schema:</p>
<p><code><pre>&lt;website&gt;any string here&lt;/website&gt;
</pre></code>
</p>
<p>In version 2.01, in order to validate against the schema the data you supply must fit the requirements of xsd:anyURI</p>
<p>N.B. xsd:anyURI does not guarantee that a valid URL will be supplied.</p>
<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>To make validation of the data at the schema level easier</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>

introduced in the upgrade of the standard from version 1.03 to version
1.04.</p>
<p>However, to ensure backwards compatibility, nothing was removed, but some elements and attributes were deprecated (i.e. still available for use, but no longer recommended).</p>
<p>In addition more elements and attributes were added.</p>
<p>Anything deprecated in 1.x has not been carried over into 2.01 (it has,
in effect, been removed)</p>
<p>If you currently report location information BUT have NOT switched to the supported way of doing so in line with version 1.04 of the IATI Standard, you will need to adjust the way you report location information in 2.01</p>

<p>While, for example, the budget element handles this correctly by simply indicating (through budget/@type) whether the budget is original or revised, a planned-disbursement currently requires a date on which the data was last updated (planned-disbursement/@updated). This is not necessary, so it is being removed and instead the @type attribute is added.</p>
<p>Making the start date mandatory (if the element is used) will improve data quality and enable publishers and data users to better check that their data is complete. See: <a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/22915067-Modify-planned-disbursement-period-start-Alter-guidance-AND-make-start-date-mandatory">Modify planned-disbursement/period-start : Alter guidance AND make start-date mandatory</a> on the support forum.</p>
<p>Making the planned-disbursement/period-end element optional allows
publishers more scope to report planned disbursements that do not have a
defined end date.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<p>If you continue to use the @updated attributes your data will fail
validation against the relevant 2.01 schema</p>
<p>The @type attribute is optional.</p>

<p id="removal-of-the-type-attribute-on-some-description-elements">
<h3><a href="#id39">Removal of the @type attribute on some description elements</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>In version 1.x of the IATI Standard all description elements have a @type attribute.</p>
<p>In version 2.01 of the IATI Standard this is only applicable to iati-activity/description, therefore the following attributes have been removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>country-budget-items/budget-item/description/@type</li>
<li>result/description/@type</li>
<li>result/indicator/description/@type</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<p>If you currently use @type on any of the elements detailed above and do not change that when creating 2.01 data, your data will fail validation against the schema. Data users should be aware that if they expect to gather data from those fields they should no longer be present.</p>

<h3><a href="#id40">Embedded codelists - Codelists added and removed</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>As part of the 2.01 IATI Standard upgrade, the Vocabulary codelist was  split into two new codelists. The following embedded codelists were added:</p>
<ul>
<li>Policy Marker Vocabulary</li>
<li>Sector Vocabulary</li>
</ul>
<p>and the following embedded codelists were removed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Vocabulary</li>

<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>The Vocabulary codelist has over time become unfit for it’s original purpose as more and more elements have required their own tailored vocabulary choices. Where vocabularies are used, they are often tailored to that particular element.</p>
<p><strong>What happens if we do not do this?</strong></p>
<p>You will need to re-organise the way you present data using the new vocabularies. If you do not do this your data may not be useable by data users.</p>

<h3><a href="#id44">Update of Schema description texts</a></h3>
<p><strong>What is the change?</strong></p>
<p>Descriptive text in the schema has been reviewed and updated.</p>
<p>In some cases, description text has been added, where it was previously missing.</p>
<p>Descriptive text no longer contains URLs (in effect they have been removed). See: <a href="http://support.iatistandard.org/entries/47188607-Removing-urls-from-schema-descriptions">Removing urls from schema descriptions</a> on the support forum.</p>
<p><strong>Where is this applicable?</strong></p>
<p>In the Activity schema, the Organisation schema and the Common schema.</p>
<p><strong>Why has this been done?</strong></p>
<p>It was recognised that various description texts were out-of-date or not clear.  This has been an opportunity to update these.</p>
<p>URLs are no longer maintained in schema text in order to maintain those links more appropriately. As part of that decision, a machine readable way of mapping attributes to codelists has been created to help developers.
